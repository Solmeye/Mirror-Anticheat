___

Mirror AntiCheat is a server-side anti-cheat designed to help server administrators detect cheating, malicious behavior, and alternate accounts, while providing tools to investigate.

The project focuses on being compatible with the latest Minecraft version (26.1+) and avoiding any false flag.

This project uses [mixins](https://docs.fabricmc.net/develop/mixins/bytecode) to filter and analyze at the packet level.
However, these mixins are currently not at a low enough level to be completely compatible with other mods

## Dependency
This mod requires [Ignite](https://github.com/vectrix-space/ignite) to work with Paper.

## Next updates
- Support for Bukkit, Folia, Purpur, Spigot and Sponge
- Configuration for ingoing and outgoing packets
- Option to disable the auto antialt check
- `/mirror freeze` command
- Other (You too can also suggest)

## Known bugs

<details>
<summary>Clients receive a damage tilt when their food levels change and their health are not full</summary>
  
- https://github.com/Solmeye/Mirror-Anticheat/issues/1
- Version.s : `0.38.0-alpha`
- Loader : `Paper`


</details>

## Packet analysis
### Ingoing
*The following incoming packets are scanned for impossible or suspicious behavior*

[None]

### Outgoing
*Subsequent outgoing packets are filtered and fake the data when a Vanilla client cannot distinguish the difference.
This is done in order to prevent or limit the effectiveness of a cheat*

<details>
<summary>Explanation</summary>
 
  - `key`

    - `identifier` Identifier where the key comes from.
Used for display purposes only

    - `keys` Key list

    - `commandsOnEachFound` Command to execute for each key when resolved by autoresolve

    - `commandsOnEachNotFound` Command to execute for each key when not resolved by autoresolve

    - `autoresolve` Automatically resolves this key group when connecting a player or not

  - `antiAlt`

    - `scoreSuspicious` Threshold to execute the commands associated. When the matching alt value is higher than `scoreSuspicious`, it means that the match is suspicious and needs investigation. Min `0` Max `100`
 
    - `scoreConfirmed` Threshold to execute the commands associated. When the matching alt value is higher than `scoreConfirmed`, it means that the match is confirmed an is an alternative account. Min `0` Max `100`
 
    - `scoreNormalCommand` Commands executed when the matching score is not suspicious or confirms an alt

    - `scoreSuspiciousCommand` Commands executed when the matching score is suspicious

    - `scoreConfirmedCommand` Commands executed when the matching score confirms an alt.
  
  - `delayAntiAltCheck`
(In ticks) Delay before checking for alts after that a player joined your server. Higher values makes it easier to disconnect to avoid the scan.

  - `webhook`
Webhook of your Discord Webhook

  - `version`
Version of the configuration. Do not touch!

## FAQ
### How does this mod work?
Mirror AntiCheat modifies outgoing network packets to remove or alter data that a vanilla client does not rely on. This is intended to reduce unnecessary information exposure without affecting normal gameplay.

### Is it possible to have a false flag?
Normally, no, with the default values.

### What is the impact on performance?
Currently, no statistics have been compiled on the CPU impact. The impact can only be negative.
However, due to the reduction in packets sent, bandwidth can be decreased.

### Will this mod backport to previous versions of Minecraft 26.1?
No.

### Can I install it on my client?
Yes. Please note, however, that this project may not work correctly if done.

### What version should I update this project to?
Alpha versions may have unstable behavior.

Beta versions are relatively stable and will not pose a problem.

Releases are the most stable.

It is recommended to update this project to the latest beta or stable version, as appropriate

### Is this compatible with [mod]?
To date, no incompatibilities have been reported. If you encounter any, please let me know.
